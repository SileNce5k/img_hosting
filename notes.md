Image hosting.
I am currently considering these languages:
* C
* C++
* Rust

I would eventually like to learn rust, so hosting an image site would probably not be a huge task while learning
a new language.

* The main site should have a simple upload form (with a password)
* There should be an API such that I could implement it with greenshot.
* Need to create a separate application so that I can upload to website (or use curl?)
* All metadata should be stripped off the image.
* Only allow image formats
* Images will get a random 4 character length character string with numbers and letter in lower case.
	* Would allow for 1.6 million images which is FAR more than what I need.
		* 1.6 million images stored at approx 6MB each would be over 9 TB.
